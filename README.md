# Creme-Egg-Bot-ReWritten
A Modular Discord Bot for playing music and keeping times

Exclaimer:
Won't work unless heavily edited first as it is made to be a personal project used by me and my friends
but if you want you can use the code or rewrite it for your own purposes

the bot isn't fully complete yet as it can't play playlists

API Keys should be in a file called key.txt with the format:

line 1 - Discord Token<br>
line 2 - Spotify Secret Token<br>
line 3 - Spotify ID Token<br>
line 4 - Google API Token<br>


addtionally you need to make two folders:
Json
Logs

if you want to create new Modules for the bot all you need to do is copy BaseModule.py and delete the functions already on it, and then write discord commands as usual and add a command in the Creme_Egg_Bot_ReWritten.py file


Unstable branch may contain bugs
